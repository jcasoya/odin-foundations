                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 package (16 ounces) phyllo dough</li>

            <h3 class="steps">Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and cook until the onions are translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned. Break up the meat with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the paprika, salt, and black pepper. Cook for an additional 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>Unroll the phyllo dough and cover it with a damp cloth to prevent drying.</li>
                    <li>Brush a baking dish with melted butter.</li>
                    <li>Place one sheet of phyllo dough in the baking dish and brush it with melted butter. Repeat this step with 5-6 more sheets, layering them on top of each other.</li>
                    <li>Spoon the meat mixture evenly over the layered phyllo dough in the baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Continue layering the remaining sheets of phyllo dough on top of the meat mixture, brushing each sheet with melted butter.</li>
                    <li>Brush the top sheet with melted butter as well.</li>
                    <li>Using a sharp knife, score the top layer of the burek into desired portion sizes.</li>
                    <li>Bake the burek in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and crispy.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                </ol>
